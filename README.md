A weather application that uses the OpenWeather API

## Description
The website is able to load and display the date using the day.js API
The save buttons on each time slot are detected in the application
However I allocated insufficient time to complete the saving of the data to the web application
I have come to terms with the possibility of quiting my job as a security guard to spend more time in the bootcamp.

Update Wed January 18, 2023: Added jQuery API and Day.js for additional functionality. 5 day forecast can now be created.

Update Friday January 20, 2023: Added local storage API to save city data. The cities can be removed from memory with remove button.
Still working on this, as multiple cities are rendered which reflect all the elements of the cities array []
