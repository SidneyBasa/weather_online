# weather_online challenge 6
A weather application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API
https://openweathermap.org/api

## Description
The website is able to load and display the date using the day.js API. <br> The save buttons on each time slot are detected in the application. <br> However I allocated insufficient time to complete the saving of the data to the web application. <br>
I have come to terms with the possibility of quiting my job as a security guard to spend more time in the bootcamp. <br>

Update Wed January 18, 2023: Added jQuery API and Day.js for additional functionality. 5 day forecast can now be created.

Update Friday January 20, 2023: Added local storage API to save city data. The cities can be removed from memory with remove button.
Still working on this, as multiple cities are rendered which reflect all the elements of the cities array []

Update Friday January 20, 2023 @ 9:19pm: The city list is being added one city at a time, instead of the entire array.

Update Sunday January 22, 2023 @ 5:12pm: Web application is fully functional. City buttons can now being added and removed dynamically.
